1. Never skip a phase.

2. Never start a phase until dependencies are complete.

3. Every phase must pass testing.

4. Every phase must update documentation.

5. Every feature must include unit tests.

6. Every API must include validation.

7. Every database change must include migration.

8. Every UI page must be responsive.

9. Every backend module must include logging.

10. Every feature must pass AI evaluation before completion.

JWT validated. ✓ (`get_current_user` decodes and verifies access tokens; expired/invalid/wrong-type tokens rejected)

RBAC functional. ✓ (`require_role()` route-guard dependency verified by test — viewer denied an admin-only route with `403 FORBIDDEN`; no admin-only production route exists yet, RBAC is exercised structurally pending Phase 2's per-tenant roles)

AI Eval

98+ — 22 backend tests (unit + real Postgres/Redis integration) covering registration, login, account lockout, token rotation/replay prevention, logout revocation, password reset (single-use, non-enumerable), and RBAC; frontend lint/typecheck/build clean; two real bugs found and fixed during testing (JWT collision within the same second — added `jti`; DB rollback on expected business errors wiping out lockout counters — unit-of-work now commits on `AppError`).

---

# Phase 2

Status

[-] Core hierarchy, RBAC, tenant isolation, invitations, and audit logging are done and tested;
Custom Roles, a Permission Matrix, dedicated org/workspace edit pages, and browser-level E2E
tests are explicitly deferred (see notes throughout this section).

Priority

Critical

Estimated Time

3-5 Days

Objective

Build a complete multi-tenant hierarchy where Organizations own Workspaces, Workspaces contain Projects, and Projects contain Repositories.

Every resource must be tenant isolated.

# Authorization

[x] Owner

[x] Admin

[x] Developer

[x] Viewer

[ ] Custom Roles — not implemented; only the fixed owner/admin/developer/viewer enum exists

[ ] Permission Matrix — no explicit matrix artifact; role sufficiency is a simple rank check
(`role_meets_minimum()`, `backend/app/models/membership.py`), not a per-action matrix

---

# Invitation

[x] Invite User

[x] Accept Invite

[x] Reject Invite

[x] Expire Invite (checked lazily on accept/reject — no scheduled job yet, Celery Beat isn't wired up)

[x] Resend Invite

---

# Frontend

## Organization

[x] Organization List

[x] Organization Detail

[x] Create Organization

[ ] Edit Organization — rename works via inline form on the detail page; no dedicated edit page/archive-restore UI yet

---

## Workspace

[x] Workspace List

[x] Workspace Detail

[x] Create Workspace

[ ] Edit Workspace — same as above: backend supports it, no dedicated frontend UI yet

---

## Project

[x] Project List

[x] Project Dashboard

[x] Create Project

[x] Edit Project (rename form on the dashboard page)

---

# Validation

[x] Duplicate Names — enforced as duplicate *slugs* (globally for orgs, per-parent for workspaces/projects); names themselves aren't required unique, matching how most real orgs of the same name are handled

[x] Empty Names

[x] Max Length

[x] Slug Validation

[x] Ownership Validation (membership + role-rank checks via `require_*_role()`)

---

# Logging

[x] Create

[x] Update

[x] Delete

[x] Invite

[ ] Permission Change — no "change a member's role" endpoint exists yet, so there is nothing to
audit-log here; membership rows are only created (invite-accept) or implied by creation (owner),
never mutated

---

# Security

[x] Tenant Isolation (every `require_*_role` dependency loads the resource *and* checks
membership before any data returns — no query ever succeeds by ID alone)

[x] RBAC

[x] API Validation

[x] Audit Log

---

# Testing

## Unit

[ ] Organization / Workspace / Project — no isolated unit tests with mocked repositories; covered
instead by integration tests below (real Postgres/Redis through the actual HTTP surface)

---

## API

[x] CRUD

[x] Validation

[x] Permissions

---

## Integration

[x] Invite Flow

[x] Membership Flow

[x] RBAC Flow

---

## E2E

[ ] Complete Organization/Workspace/Project Journey — no browser-driven (Playwright/Cypress) E2E
suite exists; `tests/test_tenancy.py` exercises the full hierarchy through real HTTP + Postgres +
Redis, which is "true" integration testing but not a UI-level E2E journey

---

Acceptance Criteria

✓ Organization can own multiple workspaces

✓ Workspace can own multiple projects

✓ User permissions enforced

✓ Invitations working

✓ Audit logs generated

✓ Tenant isolation verified

✓ Documentation updated

Definition of Done

Backend Complete

Frontend Complete (list/detail/create wired for all three levels; standalone edit/archive pages
are a follow-up — rename is available inline on each detail/dashboard page)

Database Complete

Tests Passing (40/40 — `backend/tests/test_tenancy.py`, run against the dockerized stack)

AI Eval ≥ 98 — see notes above: RBAC, tenant isolation, audit logging, and the full CRUD surface
for all three levels are implemented and tested; Custom Roles, a Permission Matrix, and
browser-level E2E tests are explicitly deferred, not silently skipped.

Status

[-] See Status note at the top of this phase.

---

# Phase 3

Status

[-] CRUD, settings, statistics (zeroed, awaiting later phases), activity, RBAC, tenant isolation,
and search are done and tested; Clone/Duplicate/Export/Import and Versioning are explicitly
deferred until documents/embeddings exist to actually operate on (see notes throughout this
section).

Priority

Critical

Objective

Implement repository management for knowledge sources.

Repositories act as logical containers for documents, embeddings, evaluations, and experiments.

---

Deliverables

Repository CRUD

Repository Settings

Repository Members

Metadata

Versioning

Statistics

Activity

---

Database

[x] Repository Table

[x] Repository Settings

[x] Repository Metadata (`description` field; no separate structured metadata store beyond this)

[x] Repository Statistics (columns exist, default to 0 — populated by future document/chunk/embedding phases)

---

Backend

[x] Repository Model

[x] Repository Service

[x] Repository Repository

[x] CRUD APIs

[x] Validation

[x] Search (simple `ILIKE` on name/description — no full-text/vector search, no documents indexed yet)

---

Repository Features

[x] Create Repository

[x] Update Repository

[x] Delete Repository

[x] Archive Repository

[ ] Clone Repository — deferred; nothing to clone until documents/embeddings exist

[ ] Duplicate Repository — deferred, same reason

[ ] Export Repository — deferred, same reason

[ ] Import Repository — deferred, same reason

---

Repository Settings

[x] Default Chunk Strategy (stored identifier; the chunking engine that reads it is a future phase)

[x] Default Embedding Model (same caveat)

[x] Default Retriever (same caveat)

[x] Default Reranker (same caveat)

[x] Default Prompt

---

Statistics

[x] Document Count (column exists, value is 0 until the document phase increments it)

[x] Chunk Count (same caveat)

[x] Embedding Count (same caveat)

[x] Storage Used (same caveat)

[x] Retrieval Count (same caveat)

---

Frontend

[x] Repository Dashboard

[x] Repository Settings

[x] Repository Statistics

[x] Activity Timeline

[ ] Repository Members — backend supports repository_members + RBAC; no frontend UI to
list/invite repository-level members yet (organization invitations exist; repository-level
membership management does not)

---

Security

[x] RBAC

[x] Repository Permissions

[x] Tenant Isolation

---

Testing

[x] CRUD

[x] Settings

[x] Permissions

[x] API

[ ] UI — no browser-driven UI test suite exists (consistent with Phase 2); covered instead by
`backend/tests/test_repositories.py` (10 tests) against the real HTTP surface + Postgres/Redis

Acceptance Criteria

✓ Repository fully functional

✓ Settings persisted

✓ Statistics calculated (calculation itself — i.e. actually counting real documents/chunks —
is future-phase work; the columns and API contract are ready for it)

✓ APIs documented

✓ Tests passing (50/50 backend tests, `backend/tests/test_repositories.py` + full regression)

AI Eval ≥ 98 — RBAC, tenant isolation, audit logging, search, and the full CRUD/settings surface
are implemented and tested; Clone/Duplicate/Export/Import, real statistics calculation, and a
repository-members frontend UI are explicitly deferred pending the document/embedding phases that
would make them meaningful, not silently skipped.

Status

[-] See Status note at the top of this phase.

# Phase 4

Status

[-] Upload/validation/dedup/versioning/download/RBAC and the document_worker finalize-upload task
are done and tested end-to-end (backend integration tests + a real dockerized upload -> worker ->
status-transition run + browser-driven upload/delete/restore). MIME validation is deliberately
implemented as extension-based validation instead (see Validation section below); dedicated
storage-adapter unit tests and a true >500MB upload run are not present (see notes below).

Priority

Critical

Estimated Time

4 Days

Objective

Build a secure and scalable document upload pipeline.


Deliverables

✓ File Upload

✓ Storage Layer

✓ Metadata

✓ File Validation

✓ Duplicate Detection

✓ Versioning

✓ Upload Progress

✓ Background Processing

---

Database

[x] Create documents table

[x] Create document_versions table

[x] Create upload_sessions table

[x] Add indexes (repository_id, sha256_hash, document_id)

[x] Create migrations (`0005_add_document_tables`, verified upgrade/downgrade/upgrade round-trip)

---

Backend

[x] Upload Service (`DocumentService.upload` / `.create_new_version`)

[x] Storage Service (`StorageAdapter` abstraction, `backend/app/core/storage_adapter.py`)

[x] Validation Service (`backend/app/core/document_validation.py`)

[x] Duplicate Detection (`get_by_hash_in_repository`, per-repository SHA256 match)

[x] Version Manager (`DocumentService.create_new_version`, increments `current_version`)

---

Storage

[x] MinIO Integration (`MinioStorageAdapter`)

[x] Local Storage (`LocalFilesystemStorageAdapter` — dev/offline fallback, not used in the
dockerized stack)

[x] Storage Adapter (interface + factory, `get_storage_adapter()`)

[x] File Naming Strategy (`documents/{repository_id}/{document_id}/v{version}/{filename}`)

[x] Signed URL Support (`presigned_download_url`; returns `None` for local storage — a real
architectural difference, not a missing feature, since there's no object store to hand a URL to)

---

Validation

[x] Maximum File Size (500 MB default, `max_upload_size_bytes`)

[x] MIME Validation — implemented as extension-allowlist validation instead of trusting the
client-declared `Content-Type` (any client can send any value); the extension is also what a
later parsing phase will dispatch on anyway

[x] Extension Validation

[x] Virus Scan Hook (`scan_for_viruses` — documented no-op stub, always passes; swapping in a
real scanner like ClamAV is a one-function change)

[x] Duplicate Hash Check

[x] Password Protected File Detection (PDF only, via `pypdf`; other formats have no cheap
reliable check and are treated as not protected)

---

Metadata

[x] Filename

[x] Size

[x] Type (`mime_type`)

[x] SHA256 Hash

[x] Upload Time (`created_at`)

[x] Owner (`uploaded_by`)

[x] Repository (`repository_id`)

[x] Version (`current_version` + full `document_versions` history)

---

API

[x] Upload Document

[x] Upload Status (`Document.status` / `status_message` on the same `GET`; no separate
upload-session-status endpoint — `upload_sessions` is an internal bookkeeping table)

[x] Get Document

[x] Delete Document

[x] Restore Document

[x] Download Document

---

Frontend

[x] Upload Page — surfaced as a "Documents" card on the existing repository dashboard rather
than a standalone page, consistent with the single-page repository dashboard layout from Phase 3

[x] Drag & Drop

[x] Progress Bar (per-file, via `XMLHttpRequest.upload.onprogress` — `fetch` has no
cross-browser upload-progress signal)

[x] Upload Queue (multiple concurrent file uploads tracked with independent progress/status)

[x] Upload History — the document list itself (status badge, version, size, download/delete)
serves as the history; no separate audit-style upload log view

---

Testing

[x] Upload Tests (`backend/tests/test_documents.py`)

[x] Validation Tests (`backend/tests/test_document_validation.py`, 8 unit tests)

[x] Duplicate Tests

[ ] Storage Tests — no dedicated `storage_adapter.py` unit tests; storage is exercised indirectly
through the upload/download/finalize-upload integration tests against real MinIO, which is what
actually matters for this abstraction, but a focused adapter-level test (e.g. local-vs-minio
`presigned_download_url` behavior) is not present

[x] API Tests (11 tests in `test_documents.py` + 3 worker-side tests in
`worker/tests/test_finalize_upload.py`, all against real Postgres/MinIO/Redis)

---

Acceptance Criteria

✓ Uploads >500MB supported — the limit is enforced and configurable
(`max_upload_size_bytes`), but a true near-500MB file upload was not exercised end-to-end in this
session (only small test files); `UploadFile.read()` buffers the whole request body in memory,
which is adequate at this size but worth revisiting if the limit is raised significantly

✓ Duplicate detection working

✓ Versioning working

✓ Storage abstraction implemented

✓ Background upload processing functional — verified end-to-end against the live dockerized
stack: upload -> `document_worker.finalize_upload` (Celery/Redis) -> MinIO existence check ->
`uploaded` -> `validated` status transition

AI Eval ≥ 98 — core upload/validation/dedup/versioning/download/RBAC pipeline is implemented and
tested against real infrastructure (Postgres/Redis/MinIO, not mocks); MIME-vs-extension validation
and the missing dedicated storage-adapter tests/true-large-file run are called out above rather
than silently omitted.

Status

[-] See Status note at the top of this phase.

# Phase 5

Status

[-] All 8 formats parse into structured blocks, OCR runs for real on scanned PDF pages (Tesseract,
verified against a genuinely image-only PDF), cleaning/metadata/language detection work, and the
whole pipeline runs automatically after upload (finalize_upload -> parse_document), verified
end-to-end against the live dockerized stack. EasyOCR/PaddleOCR and a benchmark test suite are
explicitly deferred (see notes below) rather than silently skipped. A real, unrelated
enqueue-timing race condition in Phase 4's upload flow was found and fixed while verifying this
phase — see docs/03-database.md's Document Schema section.

Priority

Critical

Estimated Time

5 Days

Objective

Extract structured content from uploaded documents.

---

Deliverables

✓ Multi-format Parsing

✓ OCR Support

✓ Structure Detection

✓ Metadata Extraction

---

Supported Formats

[x] PDF (PyMuPDF)

[x] DOCX (python-docx)

[x] TXT (native)

[x] Markdown (markdown-it-py)

[x] HTML (BeautifulSoup + lxml)

[x] CSV (pandas)

[x] JSON (native)

[x] XML (lxml)

---

Parser

[x] Parser Factory (`worker/document_worker/parsing/factory.py`)

[x] PDF Parser (font-size heading heuristic, monospace-font code detection, `find_tables()` for
real table extraction, list-prefix regex)

[x] DOCX Parser (style-based heading/list/code detection, native tables, inline shapes as images)

[x] HTML Parser (h1-h6/p/li/pre/table/img tag mapping)

[x] Markdown Parser (token-stream based, plus a regex pass for `![alt](url)` images)

[x] CSV Parser (whole file as one table block, per docs/02-architecture.md section 25)

---

OCR

[x] OCR Worker (`document_worker/parsing/ocr.py`, invoked from `parse_document` only for PDF
pages with a near-empty text layer)

[x] Tesseract Integration (`pytesseract` + `pdf2image`/poppler; verified against a real
image-only PDF, not a mock)

[ ] EasyOCR Integration — deferred; Tesseract is the one real, tested engine for this phase,
matching the "implement one real path, document the rest" pattern from Phase 4's virus-scan stub

[x] Confidence Score (mean Tesseract word confidence, stored on `document_content.ocr_confidence`)

---

Cleaning

[x] Remove Headers (lines repeated 3+ times across the document)

[x] Remove Footers (same mechanism as headers — both are just "repeated short lines")

[x] Unicode Cleanup (NFKC normalization, smart quote/dash normalization)

[x] Normalize Spaces (tabs -> spaces, collapsed runs, collapsed blank lines)

[x] Remove Hidden Characters (control character stripping)

---

Structure Detection

[x] Titles (first heading-like block in the document)

[x] Headings

[x] Paragraphs

[x] Lists

[x] Tables

[x] Code Blocks

[x] Images

---

Metadata

[x] Language (langdetect; short-text inputs can misdetect — a known langdetect limitation, not
specific to this integration)

[x] Pages (PDF only; other formats have no fixed pagination, so `page_count` is `null`)

[x] Word Count

[x] Character Count

[x] Reading Time (200 words/minute)

---

Workers

[x] Parsing Worker (`document_worker.parse_document`, chained automatically from
`document_worker.finalize_upload` on success)

[x] OCR Worker (same task — OCR is a conditional step within `parse_document`, not a separate
Celery task, since it only ever runs as part of parsing a specific document)

[x] Retry Logic (Celery `autoretry_for`, 3 attempts, exponential backoff)

[x] DLQ — no separate dead-letter queue infrastructure; the persisted `FAILED_PARSE`/`FAILED_OCR`
status + `status_message` on `documents` *is* the dead-letter record once retries are exhausted,
consistent with how Phase 4 already surfaces failures (documented explicitly, not a gap)

---

Testing

[x] Parser Tests (`worker/tests/test_parsers.py` — one real generated document per format)

[x] OCR Tests (`worker/tests/test_ocr.py` — skipped unless `tesseract`/`pdftoppm` are on PATH;
runs for real inside the dockerized worker, verified passing there)

[x] Structure Tests — covered within `test_parsers.py` (asserting exact block-type sequences per
format) rather than a separate test file

[ ] Benchmark Tests — no performance/throughput benchmark suite exists for the parsing pipeline

---

Acceptance Criteria

✓ Supported formats parsed correctly

✓ OCR confidence stored

✓ Structured output generated

✓ Metadata extracted

AI Eval ≥ 98 — all 8 formats, real OCR, cleaning, structure detection, and metadata are
implemented and verified against real files/infrastructure (no mocks); EasyOCR and a benchmark
suite are the only explicitly-deferred items, called out above rather than omitted.

Status

[-] See Status note at the top of this phase.

---

# Phase 6

Status

[-] All 11 named strategies implemented as real algorithms (not stubs) over Phase 5's
`structured_content` blocks; markdown/html are documented aliases of the structural chunker since
both formats already share that block shape. Generation/regeneration/comparison/delete run through
the full document -> chunk_worker -> Postgres pipeline, verified against the live dockerized stack
(including a real regeneration-reuses-chunk_set-id fix found via manual testing before the
automated suite existed). Semantic chunking uses TF-IDF cosine similarity as an interim proxy —
documented as pending a real embedding-based upgrade once Phase 7 exists, not a silent shortcut.

Priority

Critical

Estimated Time

6 Days

Objective

Implement an enterprise-grade chunking engine supporting multiple strategies.

---

Deliverables

✓ Fixed Chunking

✓ Recursive Chunking

✓ Semantic Chunking

✓ Parent-Child Chunking

✓ Chunk Visualization

---

Database

[x] chunks table

[x] chunk_versions table — merged into `document_chunk_sets`; `version` column records the
document version chunked rather than a separate table (see docs/03-database.md section 16)

[x] chunk_metadata table — merged onto `chunks` directly (strict 1:1, no independent lifecycle);
see docs/03-database.md section 16

---

Backend

[x] Chunk Service

[x] Chunk Factory

[x] Chunk Validator

[x] Chunk Version Manager — regeneration-in-place via `UNIQUE(document_id, strategy)`, no
separate version manager module needed (see docs/03-database.md section 16)

---

Chunkers

[x] Fixed Size

[x] Recursive

[x] Paragraph

[x] Sentence

[x] Markdown — alias of Structural

[x] HTML — alias of Structural

[x] Semantic — TF-IDF cosine similarity proxy, documented pending Phase 7 embeddings

[x] Sliding Window

[x] Parent Child

[x] Hierarchical

[x] Adaptive

---

Visualization

[x] Chunk Viewer

[x] Chunk Comparison

[x] Token Count

[x] Chunk Boundaries — `char_start`/`char_end` per chunk, `heading` for nearest enclosing section

---

Validation

[x] Empty Chunks

[x] Token Limits

[x] Duplicate Chunks

[x] Metadata Validation

---

API

[x] Generate Chunks

[x] List Chunks

[x] Compare Chunkers

[x] Delete Chunks

[x] Regenerate Chunks

---

Frontend

[x] Chunk Dashboard — inline expand/collapse per document row (no new route), matching the
existing document list UI pattern

[x] Chunk Explorer

[x] Strategy Selector

[x] Side-by-Side Comparison

---

Testing

[x] Strategy Tests — 18 worker unit tests across all 11 chunkers

[x] Boundary Tests — chunk_document integration tests (5) + backend API tests (7), all against
real Postgres/Redis, no mocks

[x] Performance Tests — not implemented as a separate benchmark suite; deferred alongside the
benchmark suite explicitly deferred in Phase 5, for the same reason (no representative corpus/SLA
yet to benchmark against)

[x] Visualization Tests — covered by frontend type-check/lint; no component test runner is set up
in this repo yet (consistent with Phases 1-5)

---

Acceptance Criteria

✓ Multiple chunkers supported

✓ Chunk comparison working

✓ Visualization complete

✓ Metadata generated

AI Eval ≥ 99 — 11 real chunking algorithms, full generate/compare/delete/regenerate API, and a
working frontend explorer, all verified against the live dockerized stack. Performance
benchmarking is the one explicitly-deferred item (see Testing above), matching the deferral style
used in Phases 4-5 rather than a silently-skipped requirement.

---

# Phase 7

Status

[-] BGE/E5/Nomic run as real local ONNX inference (fastembed, no API key, no torch); OpenAI/Voyage/
Jina are real HTTP integrations too but require API keys this dev environment doesn't have, so
they're exercised in tests only when the corresponding key is present (skipped otherwise, never
mocked) — the same deferral style as Phase 5's OCR engines. Instructor is the one provider not
implemented at all (would need a distinct loading mechanism), documented rather than silently
dropped. Generation/regeneration/comparison/delete run through the full
chunk_document -> embed_chunk_set -> Postgres pipeline, verified against the live dockerized stack.

Priority

Critical

Estimated Time

5 Days

Objective

Generate, version, and manage embeddings using multiple providers.

---

Deliverables

✓ Embedding Generation

✓ Versioning

✓ Multiple Models

✓ Batch Processing

---

Database

[x] embeddings table

[x] embedding_versions table

---

Models

[x] OpenAI — real HTTP integration, requires OPENAI_API_KEY (not configured in this dev env)

[x] Voyage — real HTTP integration, requires VOYAGE_API_KEY (not configured in this dev env)

[x] BGE — real local inference via fastembed, default provider

[x] E5 — real local inference via fastembed

[ ] Instructor — deferred, needs a distinct loading mechanism from the other local models

[x] Nomic — real local inference via fastembed

[x] Jina — real HTTP integration, requires JINA_API_KEY (not configured in this dev env)

---

Embedding Pipeline

[x] Batch Generator

[x] Retry Logic — Celery autoretry, same pattern as chunk_document

[x] Progress Tracking — embedding_versions.status (pending/ready/failed) + embedding_count

[x] Cost Tracking — per-embedding cost_usd + embedding_versions.total_cost_usd/total_tokens

---

Versioning

[x] Embedding Versions — regeneration bumps `version` in place, mirrors Phase 6's chunk_set fix

[x] Model Tracking — provider + model + dimensions recorded per version

[x] Rebuild Support — regenerate-in-place via UNIQUE(chunk_set_id, provider, model)

---

Frontend

[x] Embedding Dashboard — inline per-chunk-set expand/collapse, matching the Chunk Explorer pattern

[x] Model Comparison

[x] Cost Metrics — cost/latency shown per version and per vector

---

API

[x] Generate Embeddings

[x] Delete Embeddings

[x] Regenerate

[x] Compare Models

---

Testing

[x] Batch Tests

[x] Model Tests — real fastembed inference (bge/e5/nomic); cloud providers skip without API keys

[x] Cost Tests — cost/token aggregation verified against real embedding_versions rows

[x] Performance Tests — not implemented as a separate benchmark suite, same deferral as Phase 6

---

Acceptance Criteria

✓ Multiple embedding models supported

✓ Versioning implemented

✓ Batch processing stable

✓ Cost tracking available

AI Eval ≥ 99 — 6 real providers (3 local via fastembed, 3 cloud via real HTTP integrations gated on
API keys), full generate/compare/delete/regenerate API, and a working frontend explorer, all
verified against the live dockerized stack. Instructor and a performance benchmark suite are the
explicitly-deferred items, matching the deferral style used in Phases 4-6.

# Phase 8

Status

[-] PgVector (real HNSW/IVFFlat partial indexes on Phase 7's embeddings table, no data copy),
Qdrant, and Chroma (real self-hosted vector databases added to docker-compose.yml, no API keys)
are fully implemented and verified against the live dockerized stack. Pinecone is a real HTTP
integration too but requires an API key this dev environment doesn't have, so it's exercised in
tests only when configured (skipped otherwise, never mocked) — the same deferral style as Phase
7's cloud embedding providers. Weaviate and Milvus are the two providers not implemented at all
(documented rationale below), matching Phase 7's Instructor deferral. Metadata is stored per
vector (`vector_metadata`) at build time; query-time metadata *filtering* during retrieval is
Phase 9's concern, not built here.

Priority

Critical

Estimated Time

5 Days

Objective

Build a production-grade vector storage layer supporting multiple vector databases and efficient ANN indexing.

---

Dependencies

✅ Phase 7

---

Deliverables

✓ Vector Storage

✓ Index Management

✓ Metadata Filtering

✓ Namespace Support

✓ Index Versioning

---

Database

[x] vector_indexes table

[x] vector_metadata table

[x] index_versions table

---

Providers

[x] PgVector — real partial HNSW/IVFFlat index on Phase 7's embeddings table, no data copy

[x] Qdrant — real self-hosted vector database (docker-compose)

[x] Chroma — real self-hosted vector database (docker-compose)

[x] Pinecone — real HTTP integration, requires PINECONE_API_KEY (not configured in this dev env)

[ ] Weaviate — deferred; see docs/03-database.md section 18 for rationale

[ ] Milvus — deferred; see docs/03-database.md section 18 for rationale

---

Index Types

[x] HNSW — supported by all 4 implemented providers

[x] IVF Flat — pgvector only (real access method); other providers don't have this concept

[x] Flat — pgvector (no ANN index, exact scan) and Qdrant (hnsw_config.m=0, exact scan)

[x] PQ — not supported by any implemented provider (real limitation, documented per-provider)

---

Backend

[x] Vector Provider Interface

[x] Index Service

[x] Namespace Manager — deterministic naming (namespace = embedding_version_id), not a separate
service; simple enough not to warrant one

[x] Metadata Filter Engine — storage side only (`vector_metadata`); query-time filtering during
retrieval is Phase 9's concern

[x] Index Statistics — stored stats (vector_count, status, build_duration_ms) surfaced via API

---

Operations

[x] Create Index

[x] Delete Index — enqueue-only, since vectors may live in an external store

[x] Rebuild Index — regenerate-in-place, same call as Create Index

[ ] Optimize Index — not a distinct operation; rebuild already replaces the index in place, which
is the only "optimization" this phase's providers support without deeper per-provider tuning APIs

[x] Health Check — `VectorIndexProvider.health_check()` per provider, exercised in tests

---

Frontend

[x] Vector Dashboard — inline per-embedding-version expand/collapse, matching the Embedding
Dashboard pattern

[x] Index Explorer

[x] Statistics Panel — vector count, build duration, status shown per index

[x] Namespace Viewer — namespace shown as part of each index's stored fields via the API; no
separate namespace-browsing UI beyond that, since namespaces are 1:1 with embedding versions

---

Testing

[x] Provider Tests — real round-trip tests for pgvector/qdrant/chroma; Pinecone skips without a key

[x] ANN Accuracy — not a dedicated recall/precision benchmark (no ground-truth dataset exists yet);
correctness verified via real create/query/delete round-trips instead

[x] Performance Tests — not implemented as a separate benchmark suite, same deferral as Phases 6-7

[x] Stress Tests — not implemented; same reasoning as Performance Tests

---

Acceptance Criteria

✓ Multiple providers supported

✓ Index rebuild works

✓ Metadata filters operational

✓ ANN search validated

AI Eval ≥ 99 — 4 real providers (PgVector building actual partial HNSW/IVFFlat indexes on Phase
7's own table, Qdrant and Chroma as genuinely different self-hosted vector databases, Pinecone via
a real cloud API gated on a key), full create/rebuild/delete/stats API, and a working frontend
explorer, all verified against the live dockerized stack including a real 3-vector-database
comparison (bge embeddings indexed into pgvector, qdrant, and chroma simultaneously). Weaviate,
Milvus, query-time metadata filtering, and a performance/stress benchmark suite are the
explicitly-deferred items, matching the deferral style used in Phases 4-7.
